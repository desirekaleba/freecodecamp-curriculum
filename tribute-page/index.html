            <h2>About Norman Ernest Borlaug</h2>
            <p>Norman Ernest Borlaug (/ˈbɔːrlɔːɡ/; March 25, 1914 – September 12, 2009)[3] was an American agronomist
                who
                led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed
                the
                Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the
                Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.</p>

            <p>Borlaug received his B.S. in forestry in 1937 and Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the
                University
                of Minnesota in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position with CIMMYT in Mexico, where he
                developed
                semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties.[1][2] During the mid-20th century, Borlaug
                led
                the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production
                techniques to
                Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965
                and
                1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food security in those
                nations.[4]</p>

            <p>Borlaug was often called "the father of the Green Revolution",[5][6] and is credited with saving over a
                billion people worldwide from starvation.[7][8][9][10] According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant to
                the
                president of the World Food Prize Foundation, the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997
                article
                "Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity." The article states that the "form of agriculture that Borlaug
                preaches
                may have prevented a billion deaths."[11] He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of
                his
                contributions to world peace through increasing food supply.</p>

            <p>Later in his life, he helped apply these methods of increasing food production in Asia and Africa.[12]

            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
            <ul>

                    in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
                    how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US

                    <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
                    laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
                    returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
                    pest-resistent plants.

                <li>

                    Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
                    work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
                    other applied science.
                </li>

                    leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
                    pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
                    different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
                    varieties for each major climate on Earth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each

                <li>
                    <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
                    with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
                    well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
                    strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
                    mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
                </li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
                    increase their maize and sorghum yields
                </li>
                <li>

                    supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
                    we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
                    are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
                    plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
                    people were selecting the best breeds."
                </li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
